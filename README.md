## Sports Data Ionic Application


### **About The Project**
This project involved building a webpage which displays sports data about a chosen international football team. The application was built using Ionic Angular (Cordova) and may be run using the "Ionic Serve" command and connected to over a localhost. The user may enter settings to select the country of interest and an age range for the players. When the user returns to the homepage the application will then display a table of player details that meet the selected current settings, the flag of the selected country and an famous quote. The application utilises Ionic Storage to save infomration to the browser, therefore if the users returns to the homepages after exiting their previously selected settings will remain.The information displayed (quote, player details, flag) is taken from open APIs which the application utilises to send requests and retrieve information.
